Our goal is to understand how time, environmental and evolutionary events are represented in imperfect, gappy records and to use this knowledge to reconstruct the history of life and palaeoclimate.\nThis project is a consortium between Utrecht University and the Netherlands eScience Center. Some software used and developed in this project is a continuation of AstroTOM.

    "text": "This projects bridges two, seemingly inreconciliable, aspects of the Earth’s history: on one had, today’s diversity is only a brief snapshot of the long course of evolution and most species that once lived are only represented in the fossil record. On the other hand, the rock record is “more gaps than strata” - it preserves a fraction of the time and environments that once existed, and even that record is additionally distorted by processes such as transport or chemical reactions in the sediment.\nWe aim to understand the principles governing the stratigraphic record and apply them to improve evolutionary models, so that our understanding of what is preserved can be incorporated in reconstructing evolutionary relationships."

    "text": "Creating a toolbox to identify drivers of stratigraphic architecture\nIt is, however, still debated whether carbonate stratigraphic architectures are shaped by intrinsic or by external forcing. External forcing include changes in the tilt of the Earth’s axis and shape of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun (Milanković cycles), which affect the insolation of Earth’s surface. These periodic changes are fundamental in models of future and past climate, as well as for creating highly resolved stratigraphic timescales.\nBut periodicity formed by orbital forcing (allocyclic processes) is extremely hard to distinguish from autocyclicity, which can emerge through self organization and can take the form of Turing patterns: regular spatial patterns formed by patches of organisms or sediment. Self-organization in carbonate sediments may emerge through ecological processes, such as facilitation, or through hydrodynamic interaction of water with coral reefs or loose sediment.\n\n\n\nSpatial distribution of three carbonate facies modelled using the cellular automaton in CarboKitten.jl\n\n\nWe are working on a reactive transport model, originally proposed by Ivan L’Heureux (2018), representing the formation of periodic patterns in sediment composed of a mixture of aragonite and calcite. This part of the project is done in collaboration with Charlotte Summers and Cedric Thieulot at Utrecht University."

They disregard species which have not been sampled, even though they form the majority of the history of any lineage, and the majority of geological information in what environments and at what times in the Earth’s history these species occurred, which could inform us on the environmental context of past evolutionary events, is not or underused.\nWe develop not only methods, software and research applications, but also workshops and teaching materials on how to account for the structure of the stratigraphic record in evolutionary studies. The key tool developed in this projects is the admtools package for R, which allows constructing age-depth models free of any build-in assumptions and apply it to phylogenetic trees, records of trait evolution, proxy data and essentially any variables that can be recovered from the rock record."

Models of reef growth and sediment formation originate from the Bahamas. They are a fantastic case for studying the interaction between organisms and the marine and terrestrial landforms. Corals, algae, mangroves and seagrass are ecosystem engineers, which transform the seabed and the coastline, stabilizing it and creating spatial patterns reflecting their habitat and dispersal.\nBut one element is missing: the temporal aspect. We know how the organisms and environments are distributed today, but how fast do they move? We have secured access to a unique archive of the first aerial photographs of the Bahamas, dating back to the forties, and digitized them in collaboration with Sam Purkis (Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science, University of Miami).\nThe goal of the project is to quantify how the spatial distribution of environments changed at the time scale of a century.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect that you spend part of your project doing analysis using image processing software and are willing to read up textbook material about carbonate sedimentology and geomorphology appropriate to your study level.\nContact: Xianyi Liu and Emilia Jarochowska"

    "text": "Stratigraphic Paleobiology in Carbonate Platforms\n\nContext\nLast occurrences of fossil taxa are of great importance for paleontologists. In biostratigraphy, they provide important information about relative ages of rocks and outcrops. Clusters of last occurrences indicate a mass extinction, potentially due to rapid environmental changes (e.g. climate change, volcanic eruptions, widespread anoxia).\n\n\n\nCretaceous carbonate platform at Miravete, Spain\n\n\nHowever, this is not the only explanation for last occurrences. Every taxon lives only in specific environments, characterized by specific environmental conditions (water depth, light availability, substrate consistency, wave energy etc.). Taxa will migrate in space and time with their preferred living conditions (their niche). Last occurrences observed on the fossil record do not necessarily correspond to the extinction of a taxon, but can also be a result of local changes in environmental conditions that result in the taxon disappearing locally.\n\n\nProject goal\nThe effect of taxa tracking their niche on last occurrences has been studied extensively by Holland & Patzkowsky (2012). However, their work focuses on siliciclastic systems. The aim of this project is to exapand upon their work by translating it to carbonate systems, which form the majority of the tropical fossil record.\nIn this project, the CarboKitten.jl or CarboCAT models (Burgess 2013) will be used to simulate carbonate platforms and track environmental conditions with time. The outputs will be combined with species niche modeling in R to generate a synthetic fossil record, and examine how last occurrences systematically change along an onshore-offshore gradient and across facies boundaries and hiatuses.\n\n\nSkills and Knowledge\nDuring the project, you will learn the following skills:\n\nBasin modeling\nSpecies niche modeling and data analysis in R\nLiterature research using Zotero and researchrabbit\nVersion control using Git and GitHub\nScientific writing\n\nYou will acquire knowledge about the following topics:\n\nStratigraphic paleobiology\nEcological niche models\nCarbonate sedimentology\n\n\n\nRequirements\nBasic coding skills in any modern programming language. It is not necessary to be familiar with R or Python, but some readiness to learn is needed. You will not have to write code from scratch (unless you want to), but work with existing code and modify it to your needs.\n\n\nReferences\n\nHolland, S.M. and Patzkowsky, M.E.

    "text": "Orbital Controls of Coral Growth\nReefs are important paleontological archives that provide insights into past life and climate. One of the major controls on reef growth is energy provided in the form of sunlight. Over geological timescales, energy input is changing systematically due to periodic variations in the earth’s orbit around the sun (Milankovitch cyclicity). This orbital forcing is a major driver of climate change and source of information to derive age constraint for evolutionary studies. As a result, archive and signal are coupled, creating the potential for non-linear feedbacks and biases on how past climate is reconstructed.\nThe goal of this project is to study this feedback, specifically how\n\ncarbonate production is influenced by spatial and temporal variations of insolation\ninsolation driven variability in carbonate production changes the structure of stratigraphic columns and, in turn, inferences on orbital forcing drawn from them.\n\nFor this, insolation values from the palinsol package for the R software will be combined with the carbonate growth model from Boscher & Schlager (1992) to generate synthetic carbonate stratigraphies. These will be compared with each other to examine how they differ through time and space, and the approach from Kemp et al. (2016) will be used to examine under which circumstances the original orbital signal can be recovered from them.\n\nReferences:\n\nR package palinsol\nBosscher, Hemmo, and Wolfgang Schlager. “Computer simulation of reef growth.” Sedimentology 39.3 (1992): 503-512.

This assumes that the stratigraphic record is memorylessness and can thus be modeled via a Markov chain. The aim of the project is to test this assumption. A stratigraphic record with a longer memory can be modeled as a Markov chain of n-th order after expanding the state space. In the project, the student will assess how memory length of Markov chain models affects the capability to explain empirically observed stratigraphic successions."
