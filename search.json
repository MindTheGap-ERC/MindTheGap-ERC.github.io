    "section": "Modeling Stratigraphic Paleobiology in R",
    "text": "Modeling Stratigraphic Paleobiology in R\nThe fossil record is a joint expression of biological and geological processes. The record of biological events, such as extinction, migration, speciation, can be distorted by stratigraphic architectures, environmental factors, and taphonomy. The core idea of stratigraphic paleobiology is to incorporate knowledge about geological processes shaping these architectures into paleontological analyses to account for stratigraphic biases. Forward modelling is a way to predict and explore how a given geological section, with its gaps and changes in sedimentation rates, will record a hypothetical biological event. It is a powerful tool to formulate stratigraphic null hypotheses about evolutionary dynamics in the fossil record, which can be compared against empirical observations.\nIn this workshop, we provide an introduction to forward modelling in stratigraphic paleobiology using the admtools and StratPal packages for R Software. We demonstrate how to develop a modelling workflow that links evolutionary and ecological models (e.g., niche models, trait evolution) with outputs from forward models of carbonate platform evolution (e.g. CarboKitten.jl, CarboCAT). At the end of the workshop, participants will be able to develop their own simulation study that examines how stratigraphic architectures affect paleobiological interpretations (e.g., extinction rates, tempo and mode of evolution) from geological successions.\nThis workshop is 3-4 h long (incl. breaks) and suitable for Master students, PhDs, and researchers interested in stratigraphic paleobiology. We adjust the level to match that of the workshop participants.\nThe workshop requires basic knowledge of the R software, but no prior experience in modeling. It is designed to focus on the scientific questions and principles underlying stratigraphic paleobiology rather than coding skills. The workshop materials are available as an Open Educational Resource (OER) here.\nContact: Niklas Hohmann and Emilia Jarochowska\n\n\n\nExample workflow of a model in stratigraphic paleobiology: The sedimentological forward model specifies what facies is deposited where, and how long the gaps are (left). This information is combined with models of biological change specifies what part of the evolutionary history are preserved (bottom right), and the patterns we can observe in the stratigraphic record (top right). Here , the gaps produce artefactual jumps in trait evoltution."

Until now, most stratigraphic forward models focused on marine siliciclastic or terrestrial environments. However, carbonate platforms have entirely different dynamics, as the sediment is “born, not made” and produced mostly in situ. Carbonate platforms are also biodiversity hotspots. In this workshop, we present the first Open Source 3D forward model of carbonate platform growth using CarboKitten.jl, written in a new language Julia, developed specifically for high-performance scientific applications.\nIn this workshop, we will cover:\n\na very short intro to stratigraphic forward modeling with example applications tailored to the audience\na short intro to running Julia code and explanation why Julia was chosen for this project and how it can be used for other scientific applications\na hands-on session with CarboKitten.jl to model carbonate platform growth and explore the effects of different parameters on the resulting stratigraphy\nextracting data from the model, visualizing it and coupling with other packages in R or Python, depending on the needs of the audience\n\nThe workshop does not require any prior knowledge of Julia, but basic knowledge of R or Python will be helpful. We assume prior familiarity with the basics of carbonate sedimentology (at the level e.g. of Schlager’s (2005) textbook) and stratigraphy (e.g. Nichol’s “Sedimentology and Stratigraphy” textbook or comparable).

Models of reef growth and sediment formation originate from the Bahamas. They are a fantastic case for studying the interaction between organisms and the marine and terrestrial landforms. Corals, algae, mangroves and seagrass are ecosystem engineers, which transform the seabed and the coastline, stabilizing it and creating spatial patterns reflecting their habitat and dispersal.\nBut one element is missing: the temporal aspect. We know how the organisms and environments are distributed today, but how fast do they move? We have secured access to a unique archive of the first aerial photographs of the Bahamas, dating back to the forties, and digitized them in collaboration with Sam Purkis (Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science, University of Miami).\nThe goal of the project is to quantify how the spatial distribution of environments changed at the time scale of a century.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect that you spend part of your project doing analysis using image processing software and are willing to read up textbook material about carbonate sedimentology and geomorphology appropriate to your study level.\nContact: Xianyi Liu and Emilia Jarochowska\n\nIntroductory Reading\n\nHarris, Paul M.

Being a part of the rock record, the fossil record is incomplete, as parts of it are destroyed by erosion or not formed in the first place, thus resulting in gaps (hiatuses) in the record. Understanding where such gaps occur and how long they are is crucial if we want to use the fossil record to understand past changes. We know that gaps in the rock and/or fossil record are not random, but determined by a combination of drivers, such as sea level, insolation, and biotic interactions.\nIn this project, you will use an Open Source forward computer model (CarboKitten.jl) developed in collaboration between Utrecht University and the Netherlands eScience Center to simulate carbonate platforms under different external drivers of platform growth to explore how these drivers determine the position and duration of hiatuses.\nYou will:\n\nlearn how to program in Julia, a new programming language developed specifically for scientific computing,\nhow to run forward models of carbonate platform growth in it,\ncollaborate with a diverse team, including Research Software Engineers from the eScience Center and international scientists,\ndevelop transferable IT skills: version control and collaborative coding using git, data visualization, reproducible research, optionally: automating research workflows\n\nThe results of your project will contribute to a scientific publication.\nPossible formats: Masters thesis, guided research project, internship.

    "text": "Stratigraphic Paleobiology in Carbonate Platforms\n\nContext\nLast occurrences of fossil taxa are of great importance for paleontologists. In biostratigraphy, they provide important information about relative ages of rocks and outcrops. Clusters of last occurrences indicate a mass extinction, potentially due to rapid environmental changes (e.g. climate change, volcanic eruptions, widespread anoxia).\n\n\n\nCretaceous carbonate platform at Miravete, Spain\n\n\nHowever, this is not the only explanation for last occurrences. Every taxon lives only in specific environments, characterized by specific environmental conditions (water depth, light availability, substrate consistency, wave energy etc.). Taxa will migrate in space and time with their preferred living conditions (their niche). Last occurrences observed on the fossil record do not necessarily correspond to the extinction of a taxon, but can also be a result of local changes in environmental conditions that result in the taxon disappearing locally.\n\n\nProject goal\nThe effect of taxa tracking their niche on last occurrences has been studied extensively by Holland & Patzkowsky (2012). However, their work focuses on siliciclastic systems. The aim of this project is to exapand upon their work by translating it to carbonate systems, which form the majority of the tropical fossil record.\nIn this project, the CarboKitten.jl or CarboCAT models (Burgess 2013) will be used to simulate carbonate platforms and track environmental conditions with time. The outputs will be combined with species niche modeling in R using the StratPal package to generate a synthetic fossil record, and examine how last occurrences systematically change along an onshore-offshore gradient and across facies boundaries and hiatuses.\n\n\nSkills and Knowledge\nDuring the project, you will learn the following skills:\n\nBasin modeling\nSpecies niche modeling and data analysis in R\nLiterature research using Zotero and researchrabbit\nVersion control using Git and GitHub\nScientific writing\n\nYou will acquire knowledge about the following topics:\n\nStratigraphic paleobiology\nEcological niche models\nCarbonate sedimentology\n\n\n\nRequirements\nBasic coding skills in any modern programming language. It is not necessary to be familiar with R or Python, but some readiness to learn is needed. You will not have to write code from scratch (unless you want to), but work with existing code and modify it to your needs.\n\n\nReferences\n\nHolland, S.M. and Patzkowsky, M.E.

One of the major controls on reef growth is energy provided in the form of sunlight. Over geological timescales, energy input is changing systematically due to periodic variations in the earth’s orbit around the sun (Milankovitch cyclicity). This orbital forcing is a major driver of climate change and source of information to derive age constraint for evolutionary studies. As a result, archive and signal are coupled, creating the potential for non-linear feedbacks and biases on how past climate is reconstructed.\nThe goal of this project is to study this feedback, specifically how\n\ncarbonate production is influenced by spatial and temporal variations of insolation\ninsolation driven variability in carbonate production changes the structure of stratigraphic columns and, in turn, inferences on orbital forcing drawn from them.\n\nFor this, insolation values from the palinsol package for the R software will be combined with the carbonate growth model from Boscher & Schlager (1992) to generate synthetic carbonate stratigraphies.

A stratigraphic record with a longer memory can be modeled as a Markov chain of n-th order after expanding the state space. In the project, the student will assess how memory length of Markov chain models affects the capability to explain empirically observed stratigraphic successions.\n\nIntroductory reading\n\nMiall, Andrew D. 1973. \"Markov Chain Analysis Applied to an Ancient Alluvial Plain Succession.\" Sedimentology 20 (3): 347–64. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1973.tb01615.x."

    "text": "This projects bridges two, seemingly inreconciliable, aspects of the Earth’s history: on one had, today’s diversity is only a brief snapshot of the long course of evolution and most species that once lived are only represented in the fossil record. On the other hand, the rock record is “more gaps than strata” - it preserves a fraction of the time and environments that once existed, and even that record is additionally distorted by processes such as transport or chemical reactions in the sediment.\nWe aim to understand the principles governing the stratigraphic record and apply them to improve evolutionary models, so that our understanding of what is preserved can be incorporated in reconstructing evolutionary relationships."

We are developing an Open Source carbonate platform model CarboKitten, which is a descendant of CarboCAT written by Peter Burgess.\nIn order to account for the temporal dynamics of carbonate platforms, we collaborate with Sam Purkis on the spatial changes in the facies distribution in the Bahamas over the last 80 years.\n\n\n\nDevonian strata in the Kowala quarry (Poland)"

    "text": "Creating a toolbox to identify drivers of stratigraphic architecture\nIt is, however, still debated whether carbonate stratigraphic architectures are shaped by intrinsic or by external forcing. External forcing include changes in the tilt of the Earth’s axis and shape of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun (Milanković cycles), which affect the insolation of Earth’s surface. These periodic changes are fundamental in models of future and past climate, as well as for creating highly resolved stratigraphic timescales.\nBut periodicity formed by orbital forcing (allocyclic processes) is extremely hard to distinguish from autocyclicity, which can emerge through self organization and can take the form of Turing patterns: regular spatial patterns formed by patches of organisms or sediment. Self-organization in carbonate sediments may emerge through ecological processes, such as facilitation, or through hydrodynamic interaction of water with coral reefs or loose sediment.\n\n\n\nSpatial distribution of three carbonate facies modelled using the cellular automaton in CarboKitten.jl\n\n\nWe are working on a reactive transport model, originally proposed by Ivan L’Heureux (2018), representing the formation of periodic patterns in sediment composed of a mixture of aragonite and calcite. This part of the project is done in collaboration with Charlotte Summers and Cedric Thieulot at Utrecht University."

    "text": "Reconstruct evolution at the 104-105 years scale from empirical geological data\nModern evolutionary trees are constructed almost exclusively from genetic and morphological data of living or fossilized organisms. They disregard species which have not been sampled, even though they form the majority of the history of any lineage, and the majority of geological information in what environments and at what times in the Earth’s history these species occurred, which could inform us on the environmental context of past evolutionary events, is not or underused.\nWe develop not only methods, software and research applications, but also workshops and teaching materials on how to account for the structure of the stratigraphic record in evolutionary studies. The key tool developed in this projects is the admtools package for R, which allows constructing age-depth models free of any build-in assumptions and apply it to phylogenetic trees, records of trait evolution, proxy data and essentially any variables that can be recovered from the rock record."
