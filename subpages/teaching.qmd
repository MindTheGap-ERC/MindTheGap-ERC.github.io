We developed two educational applications, which can be used online or as desktop versions:

### Shellbed Condensator

Shiny app visualizing the effects of sedimentary condensation

-   [App](https://stratigraphicpaleobiology.shinyapps.io/shellbed_condensator/)

-   [GitHub](https://github.com/MindTheGap-ERC/ShellbedCondensator)

### Darwin CAT

Shiny app visualizing the effects of carbonate stratigraphy on trait evolution.
