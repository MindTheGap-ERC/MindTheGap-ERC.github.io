We developed two educational applications, which can be used online or as desktop versions:

### Shellbed Condensator

Shiny app visualizing the effects of sedimentary condensation

-   [App](https://stratigraphicpaleobiology.shinyapps.io/shellbed_condensator/)

-   [GitHub](https://github.com/MindTheGap-ERC/ShellbedCondensator)

### Darwin CAT

Shiny app visualizing the effects of carbonate stratigraphy on trait evolution.

-   [App](https://stratigraphicpaleobiology.shinyapps.io/DarwinCAT/)

-   [GitHub](https://github.com/MindTheGap-ERC/DarwinCAT)

-   Open Educational Resource based on the app: [Preservation of evolution in the geological record](https://zenodo.org/records/15667235) class activity for Masters or upper Bachelors level class (ca. 3 h)

### Stratigraphic paleobiology workshop

We developed a workshop on building modeling pipelines for stratigraphic paleobiology in R. The materials are [archived on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13769443) and continuously developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/MindTheGap-ERC/StratPal_workshop_materials).

### Age-depth modeling in R workshop

Developed with David De Vleeschouwer and Christian Zeeden. The materials are [archived on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15735525) and continuously developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/MindTheGap-ERC/age_depth_modeling_r/).
