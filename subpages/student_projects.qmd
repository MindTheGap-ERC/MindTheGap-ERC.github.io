## Reconstructing spatial changes in the Bahamas

The Bahamas are THE carbonate platform, a classic sandbox for all
carbonate sedimentologists and marine ecologists studying tropical
environments. Models of reef growth and sediment formation originate
from the Bahamas. They are a fantastic case for studying the interaction
between organisms and the marine and terrestrial landforms. Corals,
algae, mangroves and seagrass are ecosystem engineers, which transform
the seabed and the coastline, stabilizing it and creating spatial
patterns reflecting their habitat and dispersal.

But one element is missing: the temporal aspect. We know how the
organisms and environments are distributed today, but how fast do they
move? We have secured access to a unique archive of the first aerial
photographs of the Bahamas, dating back to the forties, and digitized
them in collaboration with Sam Purkis (Rosenstiel School of Marine,
Atmospheric, and Earth Science, University of Miami).

**The goal of the project is to quantify how the spatial distribution of
environments changed at the time scale of a century.**

We expect that you spend part of your project doing analysis using image
processing software and are willing to read up textbook material about
carbonate sedimentology and geomorphology appropriate to your study
level.

## Find the Gap: Distribution of gap durations and locations in carbonate systems

The rock record is a key source of information to understand the Earth's
history, ranging from climate change over biotic interactions to
evolution. Being a part of the rock record, the fossil record is
incomplete, as parts of it are destroyed by erosion or not formed in the
first place, thus resulting in gaps (hiatuses) in the record.
Understanding where such gaps occur and how long they are is crucial if
we want to use the fossil record to understand past changes. We know
that gaps in the rock and/or fossil record are not random, but
determined by a combination of drivers, such as sea level, insolation,
and biotic interactions.

In this project, you will use an Open Source forward computer model
(CarboKitten.jl) developed in collaboration between Utrecht University
and the Netherlands eScience Center to simulate carbonate platforms
under different external drivers of platform growth to explore how these
drivers determine the position and duration of hiatuses.

You will:

-   learn how to program in Julia, a new programming language developed
    specifically for scientific computing,
-   how to run forward models of carbonate platform growth in it,
-   collaborate with a diverse team, including Research Software
    Engineers from the eScience Center and international scientists,
-   develop transferable IT skills: version control and collaborative
    coding using git, data visualization, reproducible research,
    optionally: automating research workflows

The results of your project will contribute to a scientific publication.

Possible formats: Masters thesis, guided research project, internship.
The work can be completed remotely or fully on site. We offer regular
meetings with you and support by dedicated Software Engineers.

## Stratigraphic Paleobiology in Carbonate Platforms

#### Context

Last occurrences of fossil taxa are of great importance for
paleontologists. In biostratigraphy, they provide important information
about relative ages of rocks and outcrops. Clusters of last occurrences
indicate a mass extinction, potentially due to rapid environmental
changes (e.g. climate change, volcanic eruptions, widespread anoxia).

![Cretaceous carbonate platform at Miravete,
Spain](/img/IMG_6973.jpg){fig-align="center"}

However, this is not the only explanation for last occurrences. Every
taxon lives only in specific environments, characterized by specific
environmental conditions (water depth, light availability, substrate
consistency, wave energy etc.). Taxa will migrate in space and time with
their preferred living conditions (their niche). Last occurrences
observed on the fossil record do not necessarily correspond to the
extinction of a taxon, but can also be a result of local changes in
environmental conditions that result in the taxon disappearing locally.

#### Project goal

The effect of taxa tracking their niche on last occurrences has been
studied extensively by Holland & Patzkowsky (2012). However, their work
focuses on siliciclastic systems. The aim of this project is to exapand
upon their work by translating it to carbonate systems, which form the
majority of the tropical fossil record.

In this project, the
[CarboKitten.jl](https://mindthegap-erc.github.io/CarboKitten.jl/) or
[CarboCAT](https://github.com/MindTheGap-ERC/CarboCATLite) models
(Burgess 2013) will be used to simulate carbonate platforms and track
environmental conditions with time. The outputs will be combined with
species niche modeling in R using the [StratPal
package](https://mindthegap-erc.github.io/StratPal/index.html) to
generate a synthetic fossil record, and examine how last occurrences
systematically change along an onshore-offshore gradient and across
facies boundaries and hiatuses.

#### Skills and Knowledge

During the project, you will learn the following skills:

-   Basin modeling

-   Species niche modeling and data analysis in R

-   Literature research using Zotero and researchrabbit

-   Version control using Git and GitHub

-   Scientific writing

You will acquire knowledge about the following topics:

-   Stratigraphic paleobiology

-   Ecological niche models

-   Carbonate sedimentology

#### Requirements

Basic coding skills in any modern programming language. It is not
necessary to be familiar with R or Python, but some readiness to learn
is needed. You will not have to write code from scratch (unless you want
to), but work with existing code and modify it to your needs.

## Orbital Controls of Coral Growth

Reefs are important paleontological archives that provide insights into
past life and climate. One of the major controls on reef growth is
energy provided in the form of sunlight. Over geological timescales,
energy input is changing systematically due to periodic variations in
the earth's orbit around the sun (Milankovitch cyclicity). This orbital
forcing is a major driver of climate change and source of information to
derive age constraint for evolutionary studies. As a result, archive and
signal are coupled, creating the potential for non-linear feedbacks and
biases on how past climate is reconstructed.

The goal of this project is to study this feedback, specifically how

-   carbonate production is influenced by spatial and temporal
    variations of insolation

-   insolation driven variability in carbonate production changes the
    structure of stratigraphic columns and, in turn, inferences on
    orbital forcing drawn from them.

For this, insolation values from the `palinsol` package for the R
software will be combined with the carbonate growth model from Boscher &
Schlager (1992) to generate synthetic carbonate stratigraphies. These
will be compared with each other to examine how they differ through time
and space, and the approach from Kemp et al. (2016) will be used to
examine under which circumstances the original orbital signal can be
recovered from them.

## The memory of the stratigraphic record

Successions of facies are commonly modeled via transition matrices that
describe the transition probabilities / rates between facies. This
assumes that the stratigraphic record is memorylessness and can thus be
modeled via a Markov chain. The aim of the project is to test this
assumption. A stratigraphic record with a longer memory can be modeled
as a Markov chain of n-th order after expanding the state space. In the
project, the student will assess how memory length of Markov chain
models affects the capability to explain empirically observed
stratigraphic successions.
