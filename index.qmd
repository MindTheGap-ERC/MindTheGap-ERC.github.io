title: "MindTheGap: Quantifying the completeness of the stratigraphic record and its role in reconstructing the tempo and mode of evolution"

Welcome to the webpage of the project.

We develop numerical models to study the structure of the geological record and make better recontructions of past evolutionary dynamics. Our goal is to understand how time, environmental and evolutionary events are represented in imperfect, gappy records and to use this knowledge to reconstruct the history of life and palaeoclimate.

This project is a consortium between [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences) and [the Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). Some software used and developed in this project is a continuation of [AstroTOM](https://github.com/astro-turing). See also project record at [CORDIS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101041077).

### Project news

-   The preprint [Nonparametric estimation of age-depth models from sedimentological and stratigraphic information](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2857) has just been accepted for publication in *Geochronology*!

-   We are hosting the CycloNet meeting: a conference and workshop for cyclostratigraphers, including a field trip to Devonian and Carboniferous localities in Belgium. The meeting will take place at Utrecht University on 26th - 29th June. [Programme and registration](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences/cyclonet-meeting-utrecht)

-   Masters student Sidney Bickerton completed his research project "Spatial biases in the recovery of extinction dynamics from carbonate platforms". Congratulations!
