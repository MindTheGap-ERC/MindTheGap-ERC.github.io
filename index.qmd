## Quantifying the completeness of the stratigraphic record and its role in reconstructing the tempo and mode of evolution 

Welcome to the webpage of the project. 
We develop numerical models to study the structure of the geological record.
Our goal is to understand how time, environmental and evolutionary events are represented in imperfect, gappy records and to use this knowledge to reconstruct the history of life and palaeoclimate.

We are funded by the European Union's European Research Council Starting Grant awarded to [Emilia Jarochowska](https://www.uu.nl/staff/EBJarochowska) (2023-2028).

This project is a consortium composed by [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences) and [the Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). Some software used and developed in this project is a continuation of [AstroTOM](https://github.com/astro-turing).
