Welcome to the webpage of the project.

We develop numerical models to study the structure of the geological record and make better recontructions of past evolutionary dynamics. Our goal is to understand how time, environmental and evolutionary events are represented in imperfect, gappy records and to use this knowledge to reconstruct the history of life and palaeoclimate.

This project is a consortium between [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences) and [the Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). Some software used and developed in this project is a continuation of [AstroTOM](https://github.com/astro-turing). See also project record at [CORDIS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101041077).

### Project news

- We are hosting the CycloNet meeting: a conference and workshop for cyclostratigraphers, including a field trip to Devonian and Carboniferous localities in Belgium. The meeting will take place at Utrecht University on 26th - 29th June. [Programme and registration](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences/cyclonet-meeting-utrecht)

- We presented a show on modelling evolution and an interactive booth at [Science is Wonderful! 2025](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/science-is-wonderful) in Brussels in March.
